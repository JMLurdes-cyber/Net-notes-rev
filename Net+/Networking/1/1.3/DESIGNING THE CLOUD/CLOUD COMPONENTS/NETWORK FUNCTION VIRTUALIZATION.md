NETWORK FUNCTION VIRTUALIZATION or NFV describes the process during which physical components of the network, are replaced by logical versions of them. Those logical versions also take up the functions of the physical, fully forming a digital network with all the functionallity and logic of a physical one.
An example could be having a firewall hardware on an on-premise server, and a firewall software on the cloud one.


- **NETWORK FUNCTION VIRTUALIZATION** or NFV describes the replacement of network hardware with software running on standard servers.
- The digital version of the components also takes up the functionallity of the physical ones, virtualizing the functions inside a network.
- This makes networks easier to deploy, scale and manage.
- An example would be changing a firewall hardware with a firewall software.
