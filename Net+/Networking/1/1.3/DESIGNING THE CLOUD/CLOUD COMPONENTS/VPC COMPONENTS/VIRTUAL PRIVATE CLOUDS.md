**VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUDS** OR VPC are private networks inside of a cloud providers's network. They are used since providers usually rent out cloud services to many clients simultaneously, so there needs to be a separation between them. They can be used to have the database of a public facing-site on the cloud, since only the client should see that. 

There are several components used during the making of one:
- [[VPN]]
- [[VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD GATEAWAY - INTERNET GATEAWAY]]
- [[VPC ENDPOINT]]
