Running servers on-premise comes with numerous costs, like preparing the space required, It staff + security, and the configurations + hardware. It also is hard to scale on-demand, since it would require reconfiguring everything aside of having the hardware on-call. Due to thad, even thoug bigger companies may be able to maintain them, smaller ones would have lots of troubles.

**Cloud Computing** solves that by changing the business model. Instead of putting the costs in the bussiness themselves, a provider manages the mentioned costs, while they rent out services like storage, servers and networking over the internet. And, since it is logically managed, it can be scaled up or down as needed.
