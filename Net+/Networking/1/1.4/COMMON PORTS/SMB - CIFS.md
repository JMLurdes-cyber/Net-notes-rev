This protocol goes by two names: CIFS or **Common Internet File System** which is the outdated version of SMB a.k.a. **Server Message Block**. They both provide file sharing services, alongside printer sharing, file locking and acces rights integration accross systems.

- Originally known as CIFS or **Commno Internet File System**.
- Later down, Microsoft came with an updated, cross-platform version of CIFS, known as SMB or **Server Message Block**.
- They provide:
	- File, folder and printer sharing between computers.
	- **File locking**: Only one user may edit a file at a time, even if several are opening it simultaneously, to avoid conflicts.
	- **Authentication**: Both username and password need to be verified before accessing something locked.


### Ports Used
- Both used the [[TCP]] 445.
