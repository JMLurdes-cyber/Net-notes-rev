Ports are numbers that define the method, a.k.a **protocol**, which will use a payload when it reaches its destination. Most services tend use well-known ports to be able to connect with the wider part of devices, since the clients would need to change their ports to connect to them. 

There are **65.535 ports**, out of which **1023 are well known**. That said, both [[TCP]] and [[UDP]] have their own sets of ports.
