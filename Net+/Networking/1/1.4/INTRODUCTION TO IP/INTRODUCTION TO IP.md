Whenever a client asks for data through the net, there are several processes that they cannot see occurring on the background:
- First and foremost, the data *is not sent at random*. The network layer, through the use of [[Ip addressing]] manages to find the preferred route for transferal and uses it to send the data.
- Another thing that occurs is that data is not sent at once. Even small packages are even broken into smaller packages, which are sent over the net and rearranged on the destination device. That process is known as [[BASICS OF ENCAPSULATION|encapsulation]].

This note is the home to understand the basics about networking, and the relationships between the different systems that work on it.
