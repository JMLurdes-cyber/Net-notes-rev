- Routing loops is the name of a missconfiguration on the routing which causes the packet to be sent in circles.
- Instead of reaching the Dest. IP. it keeps goning in a loop.
- Part of the reason that makes [[TTL|Time to Live]] exist
- When the TTL expires, the router sends an [[COMMON PORTS|ICMP]] "Time exceeded" message
