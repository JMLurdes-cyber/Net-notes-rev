- **CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK** or CDNs refers to a distributed network of servers placed over many geographic positions.
- It stores copies of images, videos and game files and catches it from the closest server when there is a client requests, instead of having to go to the main.
- It ensures that a service has a "local" server, or as close as possible to it, reducing latency and clogging of networks, while increasing the efficiency.
- An example would be a server streaming location locked content.
