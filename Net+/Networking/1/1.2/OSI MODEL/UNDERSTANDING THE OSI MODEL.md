The **Open System Interconnect** (OSI) model is a conceptual model that explains how two devices communicate over the network. It is meant to act as a standard whenever there are communications or troubleshooting, or as a learning model.

There are **7 layers**, each with a specific function.

1. [[PHYSICAL LAYER]]
2. [[DATA LINK LAYER]]
3. [[NETWORK LAYER]]
4. [[TRANSPORT LAYER]]
5. [[SESSION LAYER]]
6. [[PRESENTATION LAYER]]
7. [[APPLICATION LAYER]]
